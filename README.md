# fake-discord-outage
Fake a discord guild outage with this Powercord plugin.

# How it works?
right click on a server of your choice and click "Fake outage guild"

yeah thats it...

# Other ways

you can send "triggeroutage" anywhere on another client and it will "outage" the server you are currently on
